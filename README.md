# Crypto Gadgets for Plonky2

A collection of efficient gadgets for Plonky2.

As we're building larger and larger circuits with Plonky2, we want to share some of our work and optimizations, packaged in a single and simple to use library.

## Complete Example

See the [`hello-world` example](examples/hello-world/) to get started and build your own circuit.

Or run:
```
cd examples/hello-world
cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```
(don't forget the `--release`!)

For more examples you can run the library tests:
```
cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```
